	abstract = {Recent advances in natural language processing have produced libraries that extract lowlevel features from a collection of raw texts. These features, known as annotations, are usually stored internally in hierarchical, tree-based data structures. This paper proposes a data model to represent annotations as a collection of normalized relational data tables optimized for exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling. The R package cleanNLP, which calls one of two state of the art NLP libraries (CoreNLP or spaCy), is presented as an implementation of this data model. It takes raw text as an input and returns a list of normalized tables. Speciﬁc annotations provided include tokenization, part of speech tagging, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, dependency parsing, coreference resolution, and word embeddings. The package currently supports input text in English, German, French, and Spanish.},

	abstract = {This paper critically examines emergent research with sentiment analysis tools to assess their current status and relevance to applied opinion and behaviour measurement. The rapid spread of online news and online chatter in blogs, micro-blogs and social media sites has created a potentially rich source of public opinion. Waves of public feeling are vented spontaneously on a wide range of issues on a minute-by-minute basis in the online world. These online discourses are continually being refreshed, and businesses and advertisers, governments and policy makers have woken up to the fact that this universe of self-perpetuating human sentiment could represent a valuable resource to guide political and business decisions. The massive size of this repository of emotional content renders manual analysis of it feasible only for tiny portions of its totality, and even then can be labour intensive. Computer scientists have however produced software tools that can apply linguistic rules to provide electronic readings of meanings and emotions. These tools are now being utilised by applied social science and market researchers to yield sentiment profiles from online discourses created within specific platforms that purport to represent reliable substitutes for more traditional, offline measures of public opinion. This paper considers what these tools have demonstrated so far and where caution in their application is still called for.},

We offer our datasets and sentiment analysis annotations to the research community at https://github.com/calciu/COVID19-LockdownFr. They have been obtained using high performance computing (HPC) capabilities of our university's datacenter. We think that our contribution can facilitate analysis of online conversation dynamics reflecting people sentiments when facing severe home confinement restrictions determined by the outbreak of this world wide epidemic. We hope that our contribution will help decode shared experience and mood but also test the sensitivity of sentiment measurement instruments and incite the development of new instruments, methods and approaches.},
